    <p class="note">    
    It is no news that Africans put a whole lot of their resources on  fashion and Ghana is no exception. Kente, for instance, is a fabric made and worn by <br>Ghanaians for special occasions and events.
    The history of weaving in Africa can be traced way back to 3000BC and it has since developed,<br> improved and evolved to what we have today. <br> Kente fabric originated in the Asante kingdom around the 17th century and is now a fabric that <br> is worn in all parts of Ghana and beyond today. According to history, br
    <br> Ota Karaban and his friend Kwaku learned everything they knew about weaving from a spider. <br> They told a chief in Bonwire about their expenditure who later told the head chief of Asante kingdom, the Asantehene. <br>This Asantehene later Incorporated this fabric into their culture and is still worn at important occasions till date. That fabric is the Kente fabric.

<h2>LAKE BOSOMTWE</h2>
<div class="lake">
   
    <p class="note">    
        
        Lake Bosomtwe is the only natural lake in Ghana. <br>It is situated within an ancient impact crater that is about 10.5 kilometres (6.5 mi) in diameter. <br> It is about 30 km (19 mi) south-east of Kumasi, the capital of Ashanti, and is a popular recreational area. <br>There are about 30 villages near the crater lake of Lake Bosumtwi, with a combined population of about 70,000. <br>The most popular amongst the villages where tourists usually settle is Abono
        The legends say that in 1648 an Ashanti hunter named Akora Bompe from the city of Asaman was chasing an injured antelope through the rainforest. <br>Suddenly, the animal disappeared in a small pond. It was as if this body of water wanted to save the animal's life. <br>The hunter never got the antelope, though he settled close to the water and started catching fish. This place he named "Bosomtwe", meaning "antelope god". <br>This story suggests that at that time the lake level was very low. <br>The large dead trees standing offshore in the lake also evidence this, for they are over 300 years old.

<h2>MANHYIA PALACE</h2>
<div class="Manhyia">
    <div class="sword"><img src="/pics/manhyia-palace-museum-2.webp" alt=""></div>
    <p class="note">    
        The palace was built in 1925 by the British after they had demolished the <br>Aban Palace built by Ashanti Empire. <br>The British were said to have been impressed by the size <br>of the original palace and the scope of its contents, which included <br> "rows of books in many languages",  <br>but during the War of the Golden Stool, the British demolished the royal palace with explosives. <br> The palace consequently erected is 1 km (0.62 mi) from the Centre for National Culture, Kumasi.

        <br> Upon the return from exile of the Asantehene Nana Prempeh I from the Seychelles Islands, <br>the building was offered to him for use as his residence. <br>This was because prior to the Asantehene's exile, <br> his old palace had been burnt down in the Yaa Asentewa War. <br>The war was fought between the British <br>and the Asantes <br> because of the refusal of the Asantehene to offer the Golden stool to the then governor of the Gold Coast. <br> Prempeh I only accepted the offer after he had paid for the cost of the building in full. <br> Two kings lived in the palace, namely Otumfuo Prempeh I and Otumfuo Sir Osei Agyeman Prempeh II, <br>KBE, the 13th and 14th kings of the Asante nation.
         
         <br>The old palace was converted into <br>a museum in 1995 after the new palace was built. <br> Opoku Ware II was the first king to live in the new palace, which he occupied until his death in 1999.
    
        <br>The palace was converted into a museum and officially opened on 12 August 1995 by the then king Opoku Ware II. <br> Several artifacts are displayed in the museum. <br>They include furniture used by the kings,  <br>the bronze head of Osei Agyeman Prempeh II, and a sketch map of the Asanteman. <br> There is also the Asanteman's first television at the museum, as well as life-sized wax effigies of some of the kings and queens of Asanteman.
