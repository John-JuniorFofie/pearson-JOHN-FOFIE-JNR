        <h2>TAKE TIME AND READ MORE ABOUT THE MANHYIA PALACE</h2>
    <p>The <span>Manhyia Palace</span>  (Akan: Oman hyia, English: Gathering of the people) is the seat of the <br>Asantehene, as well as his official residence. It is located in Menshyia, Kumasi, the capital of the Ashanti <br> Region of Ghana. The first palace  is now a museum. Otumfuor Opoku Ware II built the new palace, <br> which is close to the old one and is <br> where the current Asantehene, Otumfuor Osei Tutu II, resides.</p>

    <div class="history">
        <h4>HISTORY</h4>
        <p>
            The palace was built in 1925 by the British after they had demolished the Aban Palace built by Ashanti Empire. <br>The British were said to have been impressed by the size of the original palace and the scope of its contents, which included <br> "rows of books in many languages",  but during the War of the Golden Stool, the British demolished the royal palace with explosives. <br> The palace consequently erected is 1 km (0.62 mi) from the Centre for National Culture, Kumasi.

            <br> Upon the return from exile of the Asantehene Nana Prempeh I from the Seychelles Islands, <br>the building was offered to him for use as his residence. This was because prior to the Asantehene's exile, <br> his old palace had been burnt down in the Yaa Asentewa War. The war was fought between the British <br>and the Asantes <br> because of the refusal of the Asantehene to offer the Golden stool to the then governor of the Gold Coast. <br> Prempeh I only accepted the offer after he had paid for the cost of the building in full. <br> Two kings lived in the palace, namely Otumfuo Prempeh I and Otumfuo Sir Osei Agyeman Prempeh II, KBE, the 13th and 14th kings of the Asante nation.
             
             <br>The old palace was converted into a museum in 1995 after the new palace was built. <br> Opoku Ware II was the first king to live in the new palace, which he occupied until his death in 1999.

        <h2>MESEUM</h2>
        <p>The palace was converted into a museum and officially opened on 12 August 1995 by the then king Opoku Ware II. <br> Several artifacts are displayed in the museum. They include furniture used by the kings,  <br>the bronze head of Osei Agyeman Prempeh II, and a sketch map of the Asanteman. <br> There is also the Asanteman's first television at the museum, as well as life-sized wax effigies of some of the kings and queens of Asanteman.</p>
