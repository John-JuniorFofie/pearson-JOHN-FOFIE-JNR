    <div class="introduction">
        
    <p>The Asante Empire (Asante Twi: Asanteman), also known as the Ashanti Empire, was an Akan state that lasted from 1701 to 1901, in what is now modern-day Ghana. <br> It expanded from the Ashanti Region to include most of Ghana and also parts of Ivory Coast and Togo. <br> Due to the empire's military prowess, wealth, architecture, sophisticated hierarchy and culture, the Asante Empire has been extensively studied and has more historic records written by European, primarily British, authors than any other indigenous culture of sub-Saharan Africa.

        <br>Starting in the late 17th century, the Asante king Osei Tutu (c. 1695 – 1717) <br> and his adviser Okomfo Anokye established the Asante Kingdom, with the Golden Stool of Asante as a sole unifying symbol. <br>sei Tutu oversaw a massive Asante territorial expansion, building up the army by introducing new organisation and turning a disciplined royal and paramilitary army into an effective fighting machine. <br> In 1701, the Ashanti army conquered Denkyira, giving the Ashanti access to the Gulf of Guinea and the Atlantic Ocean coastal trade with Europeans, notably the Dutch. <br> The economy of the Asante Empire was mainly based on the trade of gold and agricultural exports[ as well as slave trading, craft work and trade with markets further north.
        
        <br>The Asante Empire fought several wars with neighboring kingdoms and lesser organized groups such as the Fante. The Asante held their own against the British in the first two of the five Anglo-Ashanti Wars, killing British army general Sir Charles MacCarthy and keeping his skull as a gold-rimmed drinking cup in 1824. British forces later burnt and sacked the Asante capital of Kumasi, however, and following the final Asante defeat at the fifth Anglo-Ashanti War, the Asante empire became part of the Gold Coast colony on 1 January 1902. Today, the Asante Kingdom survives as a constitutionally protected, sub-national traditional state[13] in union with the Republic of Ghana. The current king of the Asante kingdom is Otumfuo Osei Tutu II Asantehene. The Asante kingdom is the home to Lake Bosumtwi, Ghana's only natural lake. The state's current economic revenue is derived mainly from trading in gold bars, cocoa, kola nuts and agriculture.[9]</p>

    <div class="origin">
        <h4>Etymology and origins</h4>
        <p>
            The name Asante means "because of war". The word derives from the Twi words ɔsa meaning "war" and nti meaning "because of". This name comes from the Asante's origin as a kingdom created to fight the Denkyira kingdom.[14]

            The variant name "Ashanti" comes from British reports transcribing "Asante" as the British heard it pronounced, as-hanti. The hyphenation was subsequently dropped and the name Ashanti remained, with various spellings including Ashantee common into the early 20th century.
            
            Between the 10th and 12th centuries AD, the ethnic Akan people migrated into the forest belt of Southern Ghana and established several Akan states: Ashanti, Brong-Ahafo, Assin-Denkyira-Fante Confederacy-Mankessim Kingdom (present-day Central region), Akyem-Akwamu-Akuapem-Kwahu (present-day Eastern region and Greater Accra), and Ahanta-Aowin-Sefwi-Wassa (present-day Western region).
            
            Asante had a flourishing trade with other African states due to the Asante gold wealth. The Asante also traded enslaved people. At this time the trade of enslaved people was focused towards the north. The army served as the effective tool to procure captives.[15] These captives from war would go to Hausa and Mande traders and would be exchanged for goods from North Africa and other European goods.[16] When the gold mines in the Sahel started to play out, the Asante kingdom rose to prominence as the major player in the gold trade. At the height of the Asante empire, the Asante people became wealthy through the trading of gold mined from their territory.[9] European contact with the Asante on the Gulf of Guinea coast region of Africa began in the 15th century. This led to trade in gold, ivory, slaves, and other goods with the Portuguese and later the Dutch and British.

    <div class="history">
        <h2>HISTORY</h2>
        <p>Asante political organization was originally centred on clans headed by a paramount chief or Omanhene.[17][6] One particular clan, the Oyoko, settled in the Asante's sub-tropical forest region, establishing a centre at Kumasi.[18] The Asante became tributaries of another Akan state, Denkyira but in the mid-17th century the Oyoko under Chief Oti Akenten started consolidating the Asante clans into a loose confederation against the Denkyira.[19]

            The introduction of the Golden Stool (Sika dwa) was a means of centralization under Osei Tutu. According to legend, a meeting of all the clan heads of each of the Asante settlements was called just prior to declaring independence from Denkyira. Those included members from Nsuta, Mampong, Dwaben, Bekwai and Kokofu.[6] In this meeting the Golden Stool was commanded down from the heavens by Okomfo Anokye, chief-priest or sage advisor to Asantehene Osei Tutu I and floated down from the heavens into the lap of Osei Tutu I. Okomfo Anokye declared the stool to be symbolic of the new Ashanti Union (the Ashanti Kingdom) and allegiance was sworn to the stool and to Osei Tutu as the Asantehene. The newly declared Ashanti union subsequently waged war against and defeated Denkyira.[20] The stool remains sacred to the Asante as it is believed to contain the Sunsum — spirit or soul of the Asante people.</p>

         <div class="gr"><h1>FESTIVAL</h1></div>
        <div class="festival">
             
                <p class="fest">
                    <br>The Akwasidae Festival (alternate, Akwasiadae) is celebrated by the 
                    Ashanti people and chiefs in Ashanti,[1][2] as well as the Ashanti diaspora.
                     <br>The festival is celebrated on a Sunday, once every six weeks.[2][3]
                    The Akan annual calendar is divided into nine months, 
                    <br>which last approximately six weeks but vary between 40 and 42 days 
                    in a period; the celebration of this period is called the [[Adae Festival. 
                    <br>The Adae Festival has two celebration days: 
                    the Akwasidae Festival is celebrated on the final Sunday of the period, 
                   while the Awukudae Festival is celebrated on a Wednesday within the period. 
                    <br>The Friday preceding 10 days to the Akwasidae is called the Fofie (meaning a ritual Friday). 
                   As the festival is always held on Sundays (Twi in Kwasidae), 
                    <br>its recurrence could be after 40 or 42 days in accordance with the official calendar of Ashanti. 
                    During the last Akwasidae of the year, which coincides with the Adae Kese Festival, special attention 
                    <br>is given to making food offerings and donations for helping people. The Adae Kese Festival is the laregest 
                    festival in the Asanti religion. The Adae Kese Festival is about the cleansing of the Golden stool [4] 
                    <br>The festivals of Adae are not interchangeable, as they were fixed from ancient times.
